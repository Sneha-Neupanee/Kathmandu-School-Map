## What This Project Does (Quick Overview)

- Displays schools across Kathmandu on an interactive map  
- Allows filtering by school type (Public, Private, Community)  
- Visualizes school density (High, Medium, Low)  
- Supports location-based search and navigation  
- Provides real-time analytics and comparisons  
- Enables geolocation-based radius analysis

## Screenshots

Create a folder:

public/screenshots/

Add your images:

- map.png  
- density.png  
- dashboard.png  
- search.png  

Then they will render like this:

### Map View
![Map View](public/screenshots/map.png)

### Density Analysis
![Density](public/screenshots/density.png)

### Dashboard Analytics
![Dashboard](public/screenshots/dashboard.png)

### Search and Filtering

## Executive Summary

The Kathmandu School Intelligence Dashboard is an interactive Single Page Application (SPA) designed to simplify the process of discovering, analyzing, and visualizing educational institutions across the Kathmandu Valley.

Engineered with React 19, Vite, and MapLibre GL JS, it pulls geographic data from the OpenStreetMap Overpass API. The application includes non-destructive filtering, density visualization, dynamic bounds detection, and a synchronized analytics dashboard powered by Recharts.

The system focuses on usability, performance, and efficient data handling while providing meaningful insights through interactive exploration.

---

## Core Capabilities & Features

### Geographic Exploration (MapLibre JS)
- High-performance rendering of thousands of school markers  
- Multiple basemap styles (light, street, satellite)  
- Dynamic clustering using Supercluster  
- Density visualization overlay (High, Medium, Low)  

### Advanced Contextual Analysis
- Geolocation-based radial scanning using the browser Geolocation API  
- Location search via Nominatim API (forward and reverse geocoding)  
- Spatial interaction tools for map-based exploration  

### Real-Time Charts & Non-Destructive Filtering
- Toggle between Public, Private, and Community schools  
- Instant updates without removing underlying data  
- Analytics dashboard using Recharts  
- Multi-select comparison of schools  

### UI/UX Design
- Clean, responsive layout using Tailwind CSS v4  
- Sidebar navigation without obstructing map interaction  
- First-time user walkthrough using localStorage  
- Smooth transitions, overlays, and loading states

## Caching & Rate Limit Mitigation Strategy

Querying geographic data from the OpenStreetMap Overpass API can introduce latency and rate limiting.

To improve performance and avoid HTTP 429 errors, the application implements an in-browser caching system:

- Data is stored in localStorage  
- Cached responses are reused within a valid time window  
- Reduces repeated API calls  
- Enables faster load times and smoother interaction  

All filtering, density calculations, and search operations are executed client-side after initial data hydration.

---

## Technical Highlights

- Modular React architecture with separation of concerns  
- Custom hooks for data fetching and caching  
- Client-side spatial analysis  
- Efficient rendering with clustering  
- Real-time synchronization between map and dashboard  

---

## Design Approach

The application emphasizes clarity, responsiveness, and usability:

- Minimal UI obstruction over the map  
- Structured layout for intuitive navigation  
- Consistent visual hierarchy  
- Focus on performance and smooth user interaction  

---

## Notes

- Data is sourced from OpenStreetMap via the Overpass API  
- Accuracy depends on publicly available OSM data  
- Application is optimized for modern browsers
